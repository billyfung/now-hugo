Deployed using Zeit Now. 

Trying out Serverless deployment of Hugo site. 

Ideally what I want is to push a markdown file to the repo and then it will build the blog and deploy changes automatically. This will make it way easier to manage, and encourage writing because all I need to do is push a markdown file to github somewhere. 

To do:
- [ ] figure out framework for blog
- [ ] port old blog posts
